# Game Design
## Concept
This game is about the training of a hero (or villain!). Users play as the aspiring hero and make decisions, talk to people, go on training quests, and encounter events that will shape who they become. These characteristics are represented as stats -- much as you might see in a typical role-playing game -- that are raised (or lowered) as decisions are made and events occur.

## Overview
The player chooses a background -- orphan, farmer, or noble -- and is brought under the tutelage of a mentor -- an enterprising mercenary, a cunning scholar, or a nature-loving monk.

The character travels with the mentor, learning about the world as they go. There are opportunities for exploration (*OUT OF SCOPE*), combat (*OUT OF SCOPE*), dialogue with interesting characters, and honing their skills.

Eventually, a story emerges from their training, and the journey ends with the inciting incident typical of the hero's journey.

Sometimes events will directly impact the character stats, sometimes certain dialogue options will unlock future outcomes, sometimes the dialogue is just interesting, sometimes a non-playable character will say something useful about the world that you can use later on.

## Gameplay Loop
After the introduction, a menu appears where the User chooses what to spend the week doing. They have 20 points to allocate, roughly translating to four blocks per day. Users can choose to spend an additional 5 points past their max at the cost of their health and certain events triggering.

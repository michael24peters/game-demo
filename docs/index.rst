Welcome to Game Demo's documentation!
=====================================

This game is about the training of a hero. Users play as the aspiring 
hero and make decisions, talk to people, go on training quests, and encounter events 
that will shape who they are. These characteristics are represented as stats -- much 
as you might see in a typical role-playing game -- that are raised (or lowered) as 
decisions are made and events occur.
